Rather than dealing with the whole user interface as a single unit, React.js encourages developers to separate these complex UIs into individual reusable components that form the building blocks of the whole UI. In doing so, the ReactJS framework combines the speed and efficiency of JavaScript with a more efficient method of manipulating the DOM to render web pages faster and create highly dynamic and responsive web applications."

summary: React, also known as React.js or ReactJS, is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was created by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React is primarily used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

React allows developers to create reusable components, which can be thought of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the applicationâ€™s entire user interface. React's primary role in an application is to handle the view layer of that application, similar to the V in a model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. It provides efficient rendering execution and encourages developers to separate complex UIs into individual reusable components that form the building blocks of the whole UI.

React does not prescribe how to do routing and data fetching. To build an entire app with React, a full-stack React framework like Next.js or Remix is recommended. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
